# P11.2. There is no plan_versions table, so editing a plan changes every subscriber immediately. The control
# is that such a change is never silent or unattributable.
#
# P-FINAL added the other half: while a plan has billed subscribers it may be widened but not narrowed
# (BillingPlan#refuse_narrowing_while_billed, spec/models/billing_plan_spec.rb). So the edit this records is a
# widening -- which is the only kind that still reaches the audit on a plan people are paying for.
