# The classification of a row against the account needs a query, so the examined rows are bounded and the result
# says so: `total_rows` is the whole file, `previewed_rows` is what was examined. A file inside the bound is
# previewed exactly; past it the counts describe its first rows and the response states that, rather than
# reporting the rest as nothing (§C1.2 of the brief).

  # Measured, not guessed. The cost per row is dominated by the model's own uniqueness validations — which the
  # preview runs deliberately, so that whatever `Contact` would refuse is reported as refused rather than
  # discovered an hour later inside a queue. On this machine, with half the batch naming contacts that already
  # exist: 100 rows 0.62s / 217 queries, 250 rows 1.43s / 502, 500 rows 2.89s / 752. 250 is where a synchronous
  # click still feels like an answer, and it covers a pasted list exactly; a longer file is previewed as its
  # first rows and the response says so.
