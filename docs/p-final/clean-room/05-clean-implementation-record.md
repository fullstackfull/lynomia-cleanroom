# Clean implementation record

**This is technical process evidence only. It makes no claim of legal clearance.**

It records, for every file written as part of the clean-room replacement implementation, what the file is for,
what it was written from, and which already-present interfaces it depends on.

## How this implementation was produced

The implementer was given one sanitized source tree (`lynomia-cleanroom-source-20261011.tar.gz`, reassembled
from five parts, SHA-256 `cb9739abfa23b2d68942e8ef68beca35543ef4bdc0b798e23090a27a192bbd3d`, 108,294,487
bytes) and nothing else. Before any file was copied, the tree was verified to contain:

| checked | result |
|---|---|
| any `.git` directory, at any depth | none |
| any `enterprise/` directory | none |
| `spec/enterprise/` | absent |
| `*.patch`, `*.diff`, `*.bundle`, `*.rej`, `*.orig` | none |
| absolute or `../` paths in the archive | none |
| symlinks leaving the tree | none |
| clean-room specifications | present under `docs/p-final/clean-room/` |
| `app/`, `custom/`, `config/`, `db/`, `spec/`, `docs/` | present |

The repository's history begins at the commit that imported that tree. No earlier commit is reachable from it.

### Authorized sources, and only these

1. the sanitized source tree itself (upstream Chatwoot under `app/`, `lib/`, `config/`, and the clean Lynomia
   overlay under `custom/`);
2. `docs/p-final/clean-room/specs/A`–`E`;
3. `docs/p-final/clean-room/01-acceptance-test-plan.md`, `02-safe-interfaces.md`, `04-integration-contract.md`;
4. the shipped frontend under `app/javascript/`, read as the specification of the wire format it consumes;
5. the retained clean test suite, read as a statement of what clean code outside the rewrite calls;
6. third-party gem source already vendored by `bundle install` (`audited`, `devise_token_auth`, Rails), read to
   establish what those libraries actually do.

### Nothing else was consulted

No original Lynomia repository, branch, commit, patch, diff or bundle. No Chatwoot Enterprise source. No
provenance report and no blocker report. No web or GitHub search for any prior implementation. Where a
specification referenced a removed file's internals — `custom/app/models/campaign_recipient.rb:53-57`,
`:70-72`, `#update_from_whatsapp_status!`, `#mark_skipped!` — those references were treated as evidence that a
behaviour had existed, never as a design to reproduce; the line ranges named code that is not in the workspace
and was not sought out. Method names, class names, module boundaries and query shapes in this implementation
were chosen independently, which is why the one retained spec that called a removed method by name had to be
adapted rather than satisfied (see the final section).

## Files outside the five packages that were changed, and why

Each of these is clean code that is **not** part of the rewrite. Changing it was a declared decision, not a
side effect.

| PATH | CHANGE | WHY |
|---|---|---|
| `custom/app/services/analytics/campaigns/metrics.rb` | Comments only. Four references to a removed writer's method names and line numbers now name the methods that exist. | The file's comments cited `#update_from_whatsapp_status!`, `#mark_skipped!` and `campaign_recipient.rb:53-57`/`:70-72`. Those name code that is not in this workspace. The rewrite chose its own method names, as `04-integration-contract.md` §2.4 permits, so the comments were pointing at nothing. No executable line changed. |
| `spec/services/analytics/campaigns/metrics_spec.rb` | One example's two calls now use `#record_outcome!(state, reported_at:)` instead of `#update_from_whatsapp_status!(status:, timestamp:)`. The assertions are unchanged. | A retained clean spec called a removed method by name. `04` §2.4 states that "the names, arity and decomposition of every method inside your packages" may be redesigned, and the clean-room brief asks for an independent implementation rather than a reproduction of the previous interface — so the test was adapted to the new writer rather than the writer named to suit the test. What the example asserts (read-before-delivered ends as read, with both timestamps set, and the analytics agreeing) is unchanged. |
| `config/locales/en.yml` | Three new keys under `errors.custom_roles` and `errors.campaigns`. | Validation and refusal copy for the two new request boundaries. English only; other locales are Crowdin's. |
| `app/javascript/dashboard/i18n/locale/en/customRole.json` | Removed the dead `CUSTOM_ROLE.PAYWALL.*` and `CUSTOM_ROLE.ENTERPRISE_PAYWALL.*` subtrees. | `specs/C` §9 asks for the upgrade copy to stop living under another vendor's paywall name. The clean frontend had already moved to `CUSTOM_ROLE.PLAN_NOTICE.*` (`CustomRolePaywall.vue`), leaving both subtrees unreferenced. English only. |

## Schema

No migration was added. Every table, column, enum value and index the five packages use already exists in
`db/schema.rb`: `audits`, `custom_roles`, `account_users.custom_role_id`, `campaign_recipients` (including the
unique `(campaign_id, contact_id)`, the unique partial `source_id` and `(campaign_id, status)` indexes), and
`messages.source_id`/`.status`/`.external_error`. `audits.city`, `.country` and `.country_code` remain unwritten
and unread.
