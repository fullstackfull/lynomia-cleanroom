# Validations added to Inbox by config/initializers/billing.rb.
# Applies to every way of creating an inbox -- the dashboard, each provider's OAuth callback, the Platform API.
#
# Two separate commercial rules, which must not be conflated:
#   * how MANY inboxes the plan allows  -> Billing::ResourceLimit, a counted ceiling
#   * WHICH channel types it sells      -> Billing::Entitlements.channel_allowed?, a permission
#
# An account can be within its inbox count and still not be entitled to WhatsApp, and vice versa.

  # where one exists it hid the tile in the frontend and nothing more -- an administrator posting straight to
  # the inboxes endpoint got the inbox.

  # A plan that names no channels denies none, so this is inert for every plan and account that exists today.
