# One support case (docs/p9/01-architecture.md §3).
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT: a second conversation. Messages, private notes, attachments, mentions, CSAT, the channel and
# the customer identity all stay where they already are. A ticket adds exactly what Conversation has no column
# for -- a title, a category, a due date, an SLA clock, a resolve-versus-close distinction, a queryable history,
# and an operational origin -- and links to the conversation when there is one.
#
# WHY IT IS A SEPARATE TABLE: a Conversation cannot exist without an inbox (`conversations.inbox_id` is NOT NULL
# at db/schema.rb:1024 and validated at app/models/conversation.rb:77) and cannot be created without a contact
# (validated at :78, dereferenced in before_create at :308). An internal operational case -- "this account's IMAP
# inbox has been failing since Tuesday" -- has neither. The three links this table makes optional are precisely
# the three a conversation requires.
