# Lynomia WhatsApp Template Manager (docs/whatsapp-template-manager/02-local-record-design.md): one template an
# account manages. A row with no meta_template_id is a local draft Meta has never seen; a row with one mirrors a
# template Meta holds, and Meta stays authoritative for its status. Identity is Meta's own -- (WABA, name, language)
# -- scoped to the account, so one WABA never overwrites another's same-named template.
