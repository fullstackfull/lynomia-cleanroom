# One operational problem, while it is open (docs/p9/04-operations-center.md).
#
# A signal is a FACT the product observed, never an inference: "this inbox could not authenticate", "this queue
# is over its threshold", "this webhook endpoint refused delivery". There is no anomaly detection and no health
# scoring here, because neither would be a fact.
#
# Two states only. A signal is open until something observes the thing working again, at which point
# `resolved_at` is stamped and the row leaves the open set. Nothing expires a signal on a timer: a problem that
# stopped being reported is not a problem that was fixed, and letting one age out would turn silence into green.

  # Where the observation came from. One entry per writer, so a reader can tell a channel problem from a queue
  # problem without parsing `signal`.
  # `billing` added by P11 (docs/p11/07-security-performance.md): a billing failure is an operations
  # problem an operator must see, and the Operations Center is where they already look. The feed is
  # source-agnostic, so this is one entry rather than a second dashboard.

  # What was observed. Allow-listed so a typo becomes a validation failure rather than a row nobody will ever
  # find again.
  # P11 adds the three billing signals. This is an allow-list by design, which is why they have to be listed:
  # a signal nobody declared is a signal nobody checked, and the recorder's validation drops it.
