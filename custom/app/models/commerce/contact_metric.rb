# Lynomia Audience: what the orders Lynomia last read for one customer link add up to (docs/audience/03-commerce-query-model.md),
# so audience conditions run in SQL without calling a store. The figures follow Customer 360's rules
# (Commerce::Customer360) over the same orders the panel shows: the store's latest ConversationPanel::ORDER_LIMIT, so
# they are "visible", never lifetime figures.
#
# Written only by .record, from the order reads that already exist (an agent's Commerce section and the realtime
# refresh): no read of its own. A link without a row has not been read yet: unknown, never zero. The row goes with its
# link, and is dropped when the link is removed (suppressed) or points to another store customer.

  # `result` is the Commerce::Cache result of reading the link's orders. Only a new read changes the row: a cache hit or
  # a stale fallback carries the time of the read it came from, so writing it again changes nothing.
  #
  # The same write compares the read's normalized orders with the previous read's (Commerce::OrderTransitions) and hands
  # what changed to Lynomia Automation once (docs/automation/04-commerce-triggers.md): under the row lock, so two reads
  # racing never emit the same change twice; after the lock, so a rule never sees an uncommitted row.
