# The row is written when the campaign runs, because a campaign's audience cannot be reconstructed afterwards: a
# campaign stores references to labels and shared audiences, never the conditions, and membership is resolved at
# send time (custom/app/models/custom/campaign_audience.rb). Recomputing it later would invent recipients that
# were never addressed and lose ones that were.
#
# From then on the row only moves FORWARD. Meta reports `sent`, `delivered`, `read` and `failed` asynchronously,
# out of order, and more than once, so a reported outcome is applied through #record_outcome!, which holds a lock
# on the row and refuses to go backwards. `#status` is therefore the furthest point reached, while the four
# timestamps are the log of what was actually reported -- which is why Analytics::Campaigns::Metrics counts
# delivery from `delivered_at IS NOT NULL OR read_at IS NOT NULL` rather than from the status.
