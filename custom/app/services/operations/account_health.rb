# One page of accounts, each with its component statuses (docs/p9/04-operations-center.md §account health).
#
# COMPONENT STATUSES, NEVER A SCORE. There is no "87% healthy": a score is a number nobody can act on, and
# averaging an unknown into it would turn missing information into a reassuring digit. Each component stands or
# falls on its own, and the row's badge is the worst of them.
#
# NO N+1, BY CONSTRUCTION. The existing Super Admin accounts index pays two uncached COUNT queries per row
# through CountField (app/fields/count_field.rb:3-7) -- 40 queries for a page of 20. This takes one page of
# accounts and then one GROUPED query per component restricted to that page's ids, so the query count is fixed
# whatever the page size.
