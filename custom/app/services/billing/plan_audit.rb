# Records that someone changed what a plan sells (docs/p11/03-plans-entitlements.md).
#
# There is no plan_versions table, and the doc says why. The consequence is that editing a plan's features,
# limits or channel entitlements changes what EVERY subscriber of that plan has, immediately and mid-period.
# The product rule is therefore to create a new plan and move customers to it rather than to edit a plan
# people are paying for -- and because an operator can still edit one, the change is never silent: one audit
# row naming who did it, what moved, and how many paying accounts it moved for.
#
# Price is not in this list and does not need to be: a Stripe Price is immutable, so Billing::PlanSync creates
# a new one and moves subscribers from their next period (Billing::PriceMigrationJob). Nobody is re-charged
# mid-period for a price edit.
