# client, callback, webhook endpoint or token (docs/commerce/21-shopify-legacy-coexistence.md). Merchant tokens never
# live here: they are each store's encrypted credentials (docs/commerce/18-shopify-oauth-and-tokens.md).
#
# `enabled?` is the installation's provider switch. It is separate from the `lynomia_commerce` plan feature, which
# decides which accounts have Commerce at all; both are required to connect or read a Shopify store.
