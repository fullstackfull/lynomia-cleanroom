# Connects the Zid store behind an authorization code to the account and administrator named by the OAuth state
# (docs/commerce/14-zid-oauth-and-tokens.md). The code is exchanged server-side, the tokens are confirmed against Zid's
# manager profile, and only then is anything saved: a new store through Commerce::StoreConnection's ownership rules (a
# store connected to another account is never moved), or new tokens for this account's own store (re-authorization).
# Either way the store's webhooks are then registered again, with new credentials (Commerce::Zid::Webhooks).
