# Store lifecycle, for account administrators and Salla installation events. Credentials are saved only once verified
# (WooCommerce keys by the provider health check, Salla tokens by a signed installation confirmed with Salla), so a store
# is never saved as active with credentials that do not work. Audit entries never carry credentials.
#
# Every new connection of every provider, and every disconnected store coming back, passes through #attach or
# #rotate_credentials, which keep the account within its `stores` limit (Billing::ResourceLimit; disconnected stores do
# not count, an empty limit is unlimited).
