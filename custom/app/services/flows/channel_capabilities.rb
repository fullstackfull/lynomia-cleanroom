# What a flow may send on an inbox's channel (docs/flow-builder/06-whatsapp-channel-capabilities.md). The backend
# decides; the builder shows what this answers. Phase 1 runs flows on WhatsApp Cloud inboxes (the WhatsApp API and
# WhatsApp Business coexistence numbers alike); other channels are not offered yet.
#
# WhatsApp limits are Meta's documented ones for interactive messages, applied before anything is sent because
# Chatwoot's provider sends whatever it is given: reply buttons at most 3, title 20 characters; list one section (as
# Chatwoot sends it) of at most 10 rows, title 24, description 72, button 20; interactive body 1024; text 4096.
