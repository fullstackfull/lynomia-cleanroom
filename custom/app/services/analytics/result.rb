# The response shape every Lynomia Analytics endpoint returns (docs/p8/02-analytics.md).
#
# One envelope, four payload primitives, so the frontend learns the contract once instead of per endpoint, and
# so the meta block that says *how* a number was produced travels with the number rather than being implied.
#
# The meta block is the honest part. It names the timezone the buckets were cut in, the exact half-open instants
# the range resolved to, which source answered (raw or rollup) and why, and whether anything was left out. A
# chart that cannot say which timezone it used is a chart nobody can reconcile against another report.
class Analytics::Result
  # A single headline number. `comparison` is the same metric over the preceding period of equal length when a
  # caller asked for it, so "up or down" is answerable without a second request.
  #
  # `kind` is `event` for something that happened inside the requested range or `current_state` for a reading
  # taken now. The distinction travels with the number because a current reading must not be drawn on a time
  # axis or compared against a previous period, and nothing else in the payload would tell a chart that.
