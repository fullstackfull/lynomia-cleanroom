# One request answers the operational questions an overview screen exists for -- how much work arrived, how much
# was closed, how much is still open, how fast we respond, and where the volume sits -- rather than making the
# frontend stitch eight endpoints together.

  # The overview reads raw throughout. It is reported rather than assumed: the decision object names which source
  # answered and why, so `source_reason` tells an operator whether the rollup was skipped because the feature is
  # off, because no timezone is set, or because its coverage did not agree with the raw events.
  #
  # Rollups are not consulted per metric here because this screen mixes metrics that have no rollup counterpart
  # (message counts, reopens, backlog) with ones that do, and splitting the sources within one response is
  # exactly what Analytics::RollupCoverage exists to prevent.
