# What every contact-timeline adapter shares (docs/p8/03-contact-activity-timeline.md).
#
# An adapter answers one question: "what did this source record for this contact, strictly before this cursor,
# newest first, at most `limit` rows". It is account-scoped and contact-scoped on its own, independently of every
# other adapter, so no adapter can rely on another having filtered for it.
#
# What a caller may see arrives as one Visibility value rather than three keyword arguments. Conversation-derived
# adapters read its `conversations`, which is the same permission filter the contact's attachment list already
# uses (Conversations::PermissionFilterService): an agent restricted to some inboxes must not learn through a
# timeline what happened in a conversation they cannot open. A source whose visibility is ownership rather than
# channel reads its `user` and asks that source's own policy.

  def initialize(account:, contact:, visibility:, cursor: nil)
    @account = account
    @contact = contact

  # The cursor predicate for this adapter's own column, as SQL.
  #
  # Rows strictly older than the cursor instant always qualify. Rows at exactly that instant qualify only if they
  # come after the cursor in the total order (source ascending, then id descending) -- and because `source` is
  # constant within one adapter, that reduces to one of three cases, which is what this returns.
