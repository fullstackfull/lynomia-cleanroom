# Everything a contact merge has to carry across before the mergee is destroyed
# (docs/p10/04-contact-merge-linking.md).
#
# The OSS action moves four things -- conversations, messages, contact_inboxes and notes -- and then calls
# `destroy!` on the mergee. Whatever is still pointing at that row is then settled by the DATABASE, silently,
# and the settlement is not what anyone would choose:
#
#   campaign_recipients      ON DELETE CASCADE   the mergee's whole campaign send history is deleted
#   commerce_customer_links  ON DELETE CASCADE   the store-customer link is deleted
#   support_tickets          ON DELETE SET NULL  a support case loses its customer
#   commerce_carts           ON DELETE SET NULL  cart attribution lost
#   commerce_action_runs     ON DELETE SET NULL  action attribution lost
#   csat_survey_responses    dependent: :destroy_async on Contact, and never moved
#   taggings                 destroyed by acts_as_taggable_on's own association
#   contact_identities       ON DELETE CASCADE   the linked numbers and addresses are deleted
#
# P8's campaign analytics read `campaign_recipients`, so losing those rows rewrites history that has already
# been reported. This service moves all eight instead, inside the merge's existing transaction.
#
# TWO OF THEM CANNOT SIMPLY BE MOVED. `campaign_recipients` is unique on (campaign_id, contact_id) and
# `commerce_customer_links` on (commerce_store_id, contact_id), so when both contacts already have a row for the
# same campaign or the same store, moving the mergee's would violate the index. There is no way to keep both --
# after the merge they describe one human -- so the base's row is kept, the mergee's duplicate is discarded, and
# the count is returned and recorded in the audit. A discarded row is a fact somebody may need later; a hidden
# one is not.
#
# `calls` is deliberately absent: this fork has no Call model, no foreign key on that table and nothing that
# writes it (the OSS action's `merge_calls` hook is a permanent no-op here, and its comment points at an
# `enterprise/` directory that does not exist).
