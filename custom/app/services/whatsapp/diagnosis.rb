# Lynomia real WhatsApp diagnosis (docs/real-whatsapp-uat/10-real-uat-results.md).
#
# The real WABA, phone number and access token live only on the deployed server, so the live half of P5's diagnosis
# has to run there. This orchestrates that diagnosis as one read-only report, in the seven sections an operator
# works down in order:
#
#   CHANNEL            what this installation has stored          LocalChecks#channel_section
#   META IDENTITY      what Meta says the number is               MetaChecks#identity
#   AUTH               the credential, presence then validity     LocalChecks#auth + MetaChecks#auth
#   WABA SUBSCRIPTION  who is subscribed, and to what             MetaChecks#waba_subscription
#   WEBHOOK            where Meta will actually deliver           WebhookChecks
#   LOCAL PIPELINE     route, job, worker, latest failures        PipelineChecks
#   CONTACT TEST       traffic, the 24-hour window, last failure  InboundEvidence
#
# Hard rules, enforced by construction:
#   * every Meta call is a GET through the installation's existing Whatsapp::FacebookApiClient
#   * nothing is written to Meta and nothing to Redis — no collaborator has a write path to either
#   * configuration is read with a plain SELECT through Whatsapp::Diagnosis::StoredConfig, never through
#     GlobalConfigService.load, which is create-on-read; see that module for why this matters and what the one
#     remaining row is
#   * no credential value is printed, masked or otherwise; customer phone numbers are masked in one place
#   * the service never writes to stdout; the caller is handed each line and decides what to do with it
