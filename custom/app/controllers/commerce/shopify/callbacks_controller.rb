# Before the code is used, three checks, in this order: Shopify signed this query (Commerce::Shopify::Oauth HMAC with a
# fresh timestamp), the state is valid (Commerce::OauthState: signature, expiry, one use, the browser that started it),
# and the shop Shopify signed is the shop the administrator started with. The account and administrator come only from
# the state and are checked again: the user is still an administrator of the account, and the account and installation
# still offer Shopify Commerce. The browser returns to Settings → Commerce with `shopify=connected` or
# `shopify_error=<code>`; a callback that fails the three checks changes nothing and names no account.
