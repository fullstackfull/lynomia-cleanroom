# Lynomia unified identity, inbound side: a message from a number or an address an agent has linked to a
# contact reaches that contact instead of creating a new one (docs/p10/03-unified-customer-identity.md §5).
#
# Purely a fallback. The OSS order -- identifier, then email, then phone and its provider-quirk candidates, then
# an Instagram source_id already seen on a Facebook page -- is untouched and still decides every message it can
# answer. This runs only where that order returned nothing, which is the path that was about to create a new
# contact, so the cost is one indexed equality lookup on the rare branch and nothing at all on the common one.
#
# Deterministic by construction: `contact_identities` is UNIQUE on (account_id, identity_type, value), so a
# value resolves to exactly one contact or to none. Email is tried before phone, matching the OSS precedence.
# Nothing here compares names, avatars, usernames or email local-parts, and nothing merges.
# A SECOND, SEPARATE GAP, on TikTok only. TikTok writes the CONVERSATION id to `contact_inboxes.source_id` and
# the customer's real TikTok user id only to `additional_attributes['social_tiktok_user_id']`, which nothing
# reads back -- so every new TikTok conversation created a brand-new Contact for a customer the account already
# had (docs/p10/02-channel-capability-matrix.md §TikTok). That lookup is the third fallback below. It is an
# exact match on a provider-issued id, so it is as deterministic as the `source_id` match itself.
module Custom::ContactInboxWithContactBuilder
  # Channel type => [the attribute key, the WHERE fragment that the expression index on `contacts` can answer].
  # The fragment names the key literally because an expression index is only used when the query contains the
  # same literal expression, and it is a frozen constant here rather than interpolated at the call site so no
  # caller can put anything of its own into the SQL. The index's shape was measured rather than guessed
  # (docs/p10/07-security-performance.md §3.3): the expression has to lead, and the index cannot be partial.
