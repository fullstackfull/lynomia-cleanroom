  # matches, when a job is enqueued, when a template is chosen, or when a send fails or is refused.

  # One atomic statement guarded on `targeted_at IS NULL`: two workers confirming near-simultaneous sends set it
  # once, and the first send wins. That is the concurrency protection — not a read-then-write, which two workers
