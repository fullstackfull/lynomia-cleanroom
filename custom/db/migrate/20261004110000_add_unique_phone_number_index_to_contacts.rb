# `(email, account_id)` and `(identifier, account_id)` have been UNIQUE in `contacts` since Chatwoot's first
# schema. `(phone_number, account_id)` has only ever been an ordinary index, so the model's `uniqueness`
# validation was the whole of the rule — and a validation cannot see a row that does not exist yet. Two
# simultaneous creates, or one CSV import, produced two contacts sharing a number
# (docs/contacts/11-phone-uniqueness.md).
#
# Run `bundle exec rake contacts:phone_uniqueness:dry_run` before this. It reports, without taking a lock,
# exactly what this does and whether it can.
