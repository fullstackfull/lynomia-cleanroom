# Lynomia Chat production deploy.
#
# This replaces the unversioned /root/deploy-lynomia.sh. That script ran
#   git pull --ff-only && bundle install && db:migrate && pnpm vite build && systemctl restart chatwoot.target
# (docs/flow-builder/12-production-readiness.md:155) and was missing three steps, each of which has bitten or would
# bite a release:
#
#   1. pnpm install --frozen-lockfile  -- without it, the Vite build runs against stale node_modules and fails on any
#      release that adds a JavaScript dependency. Already recorded as a real failure in
#      docs/flow-builder/uat/README.md:38.
#   2. pnpm build:sdk  -- public/packs/js/sdk.js is the script customers embed on their own sites. It comes from its
#      own Vite pipeline (vite.lib.config.ts, pnpm build:sdk), NOT from `pnpm vite build`, and it is gitignored. So a
#      deploy that skips it leaves every customer site loading the previous widget indefinitely.
#   3. POSTGRES_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT=0 for the migration -- production sets a statement timeout, and a migration that
#      exceeds it is killed mid-flight. For CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY that leaves the index INVALID and the table
#      silently unindexed.
#
# It also takes a backup before touching the database, records the outgoing revision so a rollback has something to
# aim at, and verifies the services came back before reporting success.
#
# Run as root on the application server:   bash deployment/deploy.sh
#
# Behaviour on failure: stop immediately and do NOT restart. The previous version keeps serving. That is the one
# good property of the old script and it is preserved deliberately -- a half-deployed restart is worse than a
# postponed deploy.

# `.env` is a dotenv file, not a shell script, and production's is valid as the first and invalid as the second.
# `MAILER_SENDER_EMAIL=Lynomia <otp@lynomia.com>` is a redirection syntax error and
# `INSTALLATION_NAME=Lynomia Chat` runs `Chat` as a command, so the `set -a && . ./.env` this used to do aborted
# the backup on the real host. Sourcing was also the wrong tool in principle: the file is data, and evaluating it
# runs whatever it contains as root.
#
# Nor can dotenv do it for us. `Dotenv::Parser.call` performs variable AND command substitution on any value that
# is not single-quoted (substitutions/command.rb executes `$(...)` through backticks), so calling it would hand
# `.env` arbitrary code execution during the deploy, and `$VAR` would resolve differently depending on who ran it.
#
# So: take dotenv's own tokenizer -- `Dotenv::Parser::LINE`, the exact grammar the application reads this file
# with, so the dump authenticates with the same credentials the app does -- keep only the five PostgreSQL keys,
# run none of the substitutions, and refuse rather than guess if a value holds an unescaped `$`. `exec` then
# replaces ruby with pg_dump, so PGPASSWORD exists only in pg_dump's own environment, never in this script's and
